## International Criticism and Coercive Elements

The Russian system of obligatory military service and ongoing partial mobilization has been repeatedly criticized by the United Nations, the European Court of Human Rights, the OSCE, and major human rights organizations (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Memorial) for the following systemic issues:

- Widespread violence and hazing (“dedovshchina”) in military units, resulting in documented deaths, suicides, and severe injuries
- Coercive recruitment practices, including pressure or threats to sign open-ended contracts under risk of criminal prosecution
- Disproportionate call-up of citizens from ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged regions
- Use of unified electronic registries and automatic punitive measures (travel bans, financial restrictions, etc.) that severely limit civil rights for those who do not comply with summons

These mechanisms effectively remove voluntary choice and create conditions of compulsory service without a declared end date.

## Status of Partial Mobilization

No presidential decree terminating the partial mobilization announced on 21 September 2022 has been issued as of 22 November 2025. Discharge of mobilized personnel occurs only on individual grounds (reaching maximum age, serious health condition, or presidential decision). No general demobilization order exists.
